## Functions for queue handling

Big idea of gmusicproxy queue is to have static queue that can withstand hass restart  
Queue is stored in queue.json file in /data  
Queue index is also stored in track_index file  


## Simple UI for creating Queue for gproxy_player 
(https://github.com/miikkajo/gmproxy_player)  
UI is found from default ingress url, from add-on page OPEN WEB UI  
And from sidebar, if "Show in sidebar" is enabled  
And browsing directly to URL:  

/browser
http://192.168.1.1:9999/browser  

### Create new queue of tracks  
#### clear existing queue 
/clear_queue  
http://192.168.1.1:9999/clear_queue  

### Add tracks to queue
/append_to_track_queue  
params artist,album,station,playlist
http://192.168.1.1:9999/append_to_track_queue?artist=death

### List tracks in queue 
/get_queue_json

### Advance track_index and return track id 
/next_track  

### Reduce track_index and return track id
/prev_track  

### Return current track id

## Functions to return json data for external players
